  <h1>Jason is Dead</h1>
<p>Jason’s parents usually had to wake him up for school.
<br>
<br>
Jason, his mom called from the bottom of the stairs. Are you up.
<br>
<br>
A few minutes later, Jason’s dad came to the bottom of the stairs.
<br>
<br>
Are you up, he called. Jason.
<br>
<br>
He walked to the top of the stairs and turned right, opening the door to Jason’s room. Jason’s body wasn’t moving at all. It was completely still.
<br>
<br>
Honey, called Jason’s dad, without looking away from his son.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The first thing Jason did after he woke up was brush his teeth. Jason’s dad held his son upright while Jason’s mom brushed his teeth, carefully but not slowly, since he was running a little late.
<br>
<br>
Jason was wearing a Minnesota Vikings jersey and sitting in the back seat. His mom pulled into the parking lot and parked the car. Jason’s dad got out of the passenger seat and held Jason up. They walked Jason into school, his dad moving his feet across the ground, while his mom pushed him upright from behind. They walked under the banner that was above the front doors, which said “Home of Los Lobos.”
<br>
<br>
Los lobos, said Jason’s dad. That means the wolf.
<br>
<br>
The wolves, said Jason’s mom.
<br>
<br>
Right, said Jason’s dad.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
First period was Spanish.
<br>
<br>
Hola, said Jason’s Spanish teacher.
<br>
<br>
Hola, said Jason’s parents, together.
<br>
<br>
Jason’s dad raised Jason’s hand.
<br>
<br>
The teacher pointed at him. Yes, Jason, go ahead.
<br>
<br>
Los lobos means the wolf, said Jason’s dad. 
<br>
<br>
The wolves, said Jason’s mom.
<br>
<br>
Very good, said the Spanish teacher. Does anyone have any new vocabulary they’d like to introduce to the class?
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
At lunch, Jason and his friends smoked cigarettes next to the dumpsters behind the cafeteria. Jason’s mom pulled a pack of Marlboro Reds from his pocket, and put one in Jason’s mouth.
<br>
<br>
Honey, she said. A little help.
<br>
<br>
Oh sure, said Jason’s dad. He stuck out his hand, and one of Jason’s friends handed him a lighter.
<br>
<br>
Suddenly, Jason’s dad’s phone began to ring.
<br>
<br>
Hey, shut that thing off, man, said Jason’s friend. They’re gonna hear us and give us detention, dumbass.
<br>
<br>
Sorry, said Jason’s dad. He opened his flip phone. Hello, he said.
<br>
<br>
It was his manager at the office. Greg, what’s going on? It’s 12:30. Where are you?
<br>
<br>
Jason’s dad looked at his son. Everyone started packing up to go to sixth period.
<br>
<br>
Um, said Jason’s dad.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
At 3:30, football practice started. Jason played fullback.
<br>
<br>
Great tackle, Perkins, the coach yelled to Jason.
<br>
<br>
His parents smiled. They were proud of their son.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Later, at the party, everyone was smoking cigarettes and drinking beer. Some people were taking hits from a bong. Jason was there, and so was his girlfriend, Christine.
<br>
<br>
This party’s lame, said Christine. Wanna go see a movie.
<br>
<br>
Yeah, said Jason’s mom. This party sucks.
<br>
<br>
At the theater, they were showing Fast and Furious: Tokyo Drift, She’s the Man, and Flushed Away.
<br>
<br>
I want to see Flushed Away, said Jason’s dad.
<br>
That’s great, said Christine. That’s what I wanted to see too.
<br>
<br>
They bought two popcorns and some Milk Duds.
<br>
<br>
Don’t eat too many Milk Duds, Christine said to Jason. You might pull out a filling.
<br>
<br>
That’s true, said Jason’s mom. She was a dental hygienist. That’s very smart of you, she added.
<br>
<br>
Jason’s dad put his arm around Christine. She leaned into him. On the screen, there was a rat hanging from a toilet handle. He looked terrified.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Jason found a job working at a local tech startup. The office was in an office park not far from his house, which was convenient. Jason did customer service. He wore a headset and pressed a red button when the phone rang.
<br>
<br>
TechWave, this is Jason. How can I help you today.
