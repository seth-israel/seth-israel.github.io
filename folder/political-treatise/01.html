<b>by the time i finish drinking this glass of pomegranate juice i will be insane</b>

they are offering vietnamese language classes
at the community center now
i think that’s interesting
i think what do i need to do today

i remember the package i ordered
i ordered a textbook
i look on the internet
patti smith is in ‘gardone riviera’
i realize i don't care
i unfollow patti smith

i get an email from my mom
her profile picture is at the top
i want to meditate
i hear her voice upstairs
i think of the phrase “10-day silent meditation retreat”
there are a lot of ways to get the same result in html/css
this feels overwhelming to me

i'm trying to watch a youtube video
the ad before the video is about quitting vaping
and i want to destroy the things that made its existence possible

in the bicycle race
pedaling is happening extremely fast
i wonder how they organize this legally
there seems to be significant liability danger,
not only for the competitors, but for the spectators as well
they must organize it illegally, i think
