<b>if other parts of my body hurt then the pain from getting a filling in my tooth tomorrow will seem less noticeable because the default sensation of my body will be pain</b>

i "need" a lenovo thinkpad
if the only type of photograph
that existed was black & white
things would get better
i haven't done anything today
the temperature increases
i'm getting a filling tomorrow at 7:30am
after looking at the sky for 4 hours
i resolved to pull weeds for 4 hours
since i couldn’t think of anything else to do
i don’t want to kill weeds
but i have to concede
to the hegemonic forces of society, at some point
physically
some of the weeds are stronger than me
and mentally
i can write poetry from anywhere
but depending on where i am the poetry will be different
if i can accept the arbitrariness of the world
my life will get better
