<b>really long poem that’s longer than paradise lost/the odyssey/the cantos combined / yellow & green notepad poem that’s been edited for legal reasons</b>

no one can fix anyone’s life
maybe someone can
i don’t know
i want to help people
but i don’t want to do anything
therefore i want to help people while doing nothing
i hope my neighbor can’t see me peeing
i hope an enormous 20-ton 18-wheeler does not hit me on a narrow 1-way street
i apologize to anyone who’s ever had to read something i’ve written
i apologize to anyone reading this
i hope no one ever has to read my writing again
i hope i never have to see anyone again
besides a list of like 7 people i wrote in my room
kohl’s, old navy, target, k-mart, walmart, jc penney, macy’s, sears, or burlington coat factory
will use the word “drip” in a promotional campaign in the next five years
i’m unsure of how big my parentheses should be
i’m insecure about this
my teacher said words “are inherently phallic”
she seems insecure about words
i emailed the person who taught my poetry class apologizing for what i wrote
i apologize for this poem
with this poem, i become the most interesting verse stylist of my generation,
which doesn’t mean that this poem isn’t a boring poem
tao lin said this
bret easton ellis told him to say it
i’m reading/writing this in my bathroom
i think you can do that
“twitter” is “poetry”
michael silverblatt confirmed this
i’m going to dragon kick john travolta in the head
because i’m making purely hypothetical death threats
and i don’t want to go to jail
my upstairs neighbor is an interpretive dancer
/is currently being waterboarded
i found this through “market research”
i want to be an “insane band kid”
who is bald/carrying a trombone case around
i don’t understand what blushing is
i have never experienced it, i think
if you have a multisyllabic name
you’re just an asshole who wants to waste people’s time
i had the most money i’ve had in my bank account
on the same day i had diarrhea 7-8 times
my goal is to have 0 social interactions
from now until an indefinite time
if i could grow a mustache
i would have a huge mustache
on my face immediately
the pulitzer prize is fake
everything is fake
that was stupid
this poem is all i have left
