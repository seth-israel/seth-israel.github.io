 <h4>Stars of the Lid - And Their Refinement of the Decline (2007)</h4>
 <p>started listening to this some time the week of May 30th, 2022. at that time i just listened to the first track, then decided it didn’t fit the mood. then i listened to tracks 2-12 around 11pm on June 9th, while responding to an email and editing/formatting this page. finished listening to tracks 13-18 on June 13th, sitting on the porch, entering info into TMDB. it’s so calming, even though i know i can’t just listen to it whenever. helped me relax after i was getting stressed by stuff earlier tonight.


 <h4>Oval - Systemisch (1994)</h4>
 <p>listened to this on my porch on June 9th from ~9 till ~10pm while reading On Becoming a Person. it got a lot colder and darker outside over the time I listened to it. i felt distracted from reading/listening by being nervous about a dentist appointment tomorrow. my mom came on the porch around halfway through the album, then left after about 15 minutes. i found this album from Julien Donkey-Boy. the song Mediation, track 6, is used in the movie, i think over a series of stills and maybe bleeding into another scene. i wonder how Harmony Korine found the album/track, or if it was obscure at the time. when i heard it i initially thought it sounded like OPN, like r+7 or Garden of Delete type OPN. i listened to the album from front to back once last week, i think (i just checked my notes and i wrote that i listened to it on Friday, June 3rd). i like this album because it doesn’t feel particularly dark, like written in a somber minor key or overly slow, and there’s percussion, which feels engaging, like i can phase in and out of the track comfortably and not feel confused or like i missed something. it doesn’t feel like it’s trying to make me feel one way or another; in this sense it feels “ambient.” i don’t really want to listen to a song that feels like it’s trying to aggressively influence my mood in some way. i like that it’s a little noisy, like white noise at times, without being overly harsh or grating. i read the Wikipedia page for Oval, and apparently they made a lot of their music in part by scratching and distorting CDs.</p>
