 <h4>POLITICAL TREATISE</h4>
 <p>"i feel that my poetry is fucking stupid" —Tao Lin, <i>this emotion was a little e-book</i></p>

He seems content at the thought of things
We remain under the impression that the cycles of professional sports establish the units of time

If and when I concede to him,
the dog’s drool will have finished drying on the pleather couch

Three backyards away
you see smoke rising through oak and maple leaves
which happen to be backlit in the morning
The fire alarm is sounding
a helicopter hovers overhead
It’s probably fine
It’s a national holiday

Don’t you think
if that was really the case
We would’ve heard about it?

There’s no point trying to explain this obliquely
You can do that for yourself
 </pre>

I have to remember
to juggle all these things in my mind
I feel responsible—at the very least—to do that
What I remember most
is sitting in the backseat on Sundays
driving to nearby locales
that were much better
put together than our locale
You can disappear into a forest
that looks like Germany
on the side of the veteran’s highway
You can go to farms, cemeteries, hospitals,
and eat Japanese food at a strip mall

6 aphorisms
The best way to look at clouds is on an inversion table in your garage????????????????????
If a beautiful woman invites you to a museum it is for the furthering of scientific research????????????????????
“American” food is calorie rich, nutrient deficient????????????????????
Babies are socially acceptable dolls for adults????????????????????
Exercise is the same as drugs, but inverted, because you feel shitty when doing it and good after????????????????????
The “perfect hooded sweatshirt” is earned, not given????????????????????

They are offering Vietnamese language classes
at the community center now
I think, “That’s interesting”
I think, What do I need to do today

I remember the package I ordered
I ordered a textbook
I look on the internet
Patti Smith is in ‘Gardone Riviera’
I realize I don't care
I unfollow Patti Smith

I get an email from my mom
Her profile picture is at the top
I want to meditate
I hear her voice upstairs
I think of the phrase “10-day silent meditation retreat”
There are a lot of ways to get the same result in HTML/CSS
This feels overwhelming to me

I'm trying to watch a Youtube video
The ad before the video is about quitting vaping
and I want to destroy the things that made its existence possible

In the bicycle race
pedaling is happening extremely fast
I wonder how they organize this legally
There seems to be significant liability danger,
not only for the competitors, but for the spectators as well
They must organize it illegally, I think

Lev was on the lower, non-basement level of his university’s library, scanning a book with a scanning machine. He was listening to music loudly through headphones. A women’s restroom was 6 feet to his left, which, Lev noticed, was used more frequently than the men’s restroom, 15 feet in the other direction. Lev occasionally worried about the bacterial dangers of bathroom air. He sensed the presence of a person behind him.

“Hello,” a voice said.

Lev turned around and saw a tall bald man. Suddenly he was to Lev’s left, obstructing his view of the women’s restroom door. He held out his fist ambiguously. Lev wasn’t sure what to do with it, but fearing a faux pas, lightly touched his knuckles to the man’s fist.

“I’m Marcus,” the man said. Lev was about to say, “I’m Lev,” but the man kept talking. “Are you staff here? You work with Jen. Behind the desk.”

“Yeah,” Lev said, “I work with Jen.”

“I do reshelving,” Marcus said. “What year are you.”

“Senior,” said Lev.

“So that means,” Marcus said. He looked toward the ceiling. “You graduate. 2019.”

“Yeah,” said Lev, “I graduate in the spring.”

“My son went here,” Marcus said, as somewhat of a non-sequitur. “He graduated… ‘16.5. When did you get here.”

“2015,” Lev said. “Fall 2015.”

“My son did the memes about the snow days,” said Marcus. “I don’t know if you ever saw them.”

“Yeah,” said Lev. He thought that he never saw anything like that, but maybe had a vague memory of someone talking about it, as a retrospective event in his memory of hearing about it, a memory inside a memory. “I’m familiar with them.”

“He studied psychology,” said Marcus. “He wanted to be a doctor but then he didn’t want to be. Then he moved to San Francisco to work. Boom. Recession. Couldn’t work. Now he’s at Stanford. Doing a masters in psychology.” Marcus was in the doorway of the single-occupancy bathroom adjacent to the women’s restroom. His body was in the bathroom and he was turning his head toward Lev.

“That’s good,” said Lev. “Good stuff,” he said, a phrase he had heard other people use in casual conversations, that had once been in his lexicon, but had slowly detached from it, like a leaf from a tree.

“Where are you from,” said Marcus.

“Outside Philly,” said Lev. “Like 45 minutes from here.”

“Eagles lost last night,” said Marcus. “But Phillies won. They’re doing good.”

Lev had seen a 7-10 second clip of the Dallas Cowboys scoring a touchdown in overtime to beat the Eagles last night, while scrolling through the internet.

“A win and a loss,” Lev said. He shrugged his shoulders. All of Marcus’s body but his head was in the bathroom.

“Phillies are playing tonight,” Marcus said. He closed the door.

“Cool,” said Lev.

 <p>I was driving on the highway, near some office parks and malls, next to the river, and I pulled over on the side of the road. There was a car wash and a large man standing inside one of the bays, spraying a car with a pressurized hose. I walked up to him and touched him on the shoulder. I said something. He turned around and looked at me. He started spraying me with the hose. I said stop. I made noises indicating pain. He turned around and turned on the car wash. The man was obese. A medical professional would classify him as morbidly obese, if given the opportunity to do so. All the machines were spraying me with water and soap. I was laying on the ground. I said stop. I was drowning in the water. The car wash was flooding. The man got in the car in the bay. It was his car. He barely fit inside. He drove away. The sun was going down.</p>
