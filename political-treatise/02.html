<b>I need to take risks or else I’m going to die</b>

Cars driving by your house sound like waves on the beach
In Fiji or something
Except they honk and play music
And sound nothing like waves on the beach
Both of them can kill small children
I don’t know where Fiji is on a map

I have technology in development that will cause me to self-immolate if I put on “work appropriate attire”
And I’m deliberating over shades of brushed steel for my bathroom appliances
And I’m going to concede to the pressures of corporate professionalism
