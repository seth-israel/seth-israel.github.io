<b>If other parts of my body hurt then the pain from getting a filling in my tooth tomorrow will seem less noticeable because the default sensation of my body will be pain</b>

I "need" a Lenovo ThinkPad

If the only type of photograph

that existed was black & white

things would get better

I haven't done anything today

now it's hot

I'm getting a filling tomorrow at 7:30am

After looking at the sky for 4 hours

I resolved to pull weeds for 4 hours

Since I couldn’t think of anything else to do

I don’t want to kill weeds

But someone said it has to happen

Some of the weeds are stronger than me

Physically

And mentally

I can write poetry from anywhere

But depending on where I am the poetry will be different

If I accept the arbitrariness of the world my life will get better
